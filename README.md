A simple Text Dungeon game for the 2021 Game Off


## Info

This is my first game made with golang, and as I joined the Game Off a little late, I decided to make a text dungeon while using this game jam as an excuse to learn more game and graphics libraries like SDL, OpenGL, GLFW, etc.. I'm also busy with personal things at the moment, so I don't have much time to put a ton of effort into the Game Off(I'm sorry).

## Building From Source

If you're going to build the game from source, make sure you have the Go 1.17.1 Compiler installed on your pc.
